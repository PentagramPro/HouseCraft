HouseCraft
==========

This game is made with Unity for tablet PCs. 

In this game your goal is to earn money by reselling houses.

Each level is an empty house freshly bought without even walls. You have to plan rooms and set up some equipment like heaters and bathtubs. When everything is ready, you can try to sell your house and try to make profit on improvements you made.
Each right decision gives additional income. Each wrong leads to losses and penalties. Be careful in planning.
Level is counted completed when your income exceeds all your expences.
